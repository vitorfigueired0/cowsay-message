### Setup for Automatic Execution
To make the cowsay.sh script run automatically whenever you open the terminal, follow these instructions for your shell:

#### Bash and Sh
Open the configuration file:

- For bash: edit the ~/.bashrc file.
- For sh: edit the ~/.profile file.
Add the script call at the end of the file:

```bash
/path/to/your/script/cowsay.sh
```
Save and close the file.


### Zsh
Open the configuration file:

Edit the ~/.zshrc file.
Add the script call at the end of the file:

```bash
/path/to/your/script/cowsay.sh
```
Save and close the file.

#### Permissions
Ensure the script has execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/script/cowsay.sh
```

After setting this up, the script will automatically execute each time you open a new terminal.
